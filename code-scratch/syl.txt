Edit the coordinates and click to see the sprite’s position
•A) goto x=200, y=0
•B) goto x=-200, y=0
•C) goto x=200, y=-100
Where does the cat go?


Create a script to glide the sprite along the sides of a triangle. The first vertex  is (-100, -100). The second vertex is (200, -100). The third vertex is (50, 100). 
Change the speed of gliding and run again.


Drawing a Circle

Start at ( -100, 100 )
•Move 200 steps
•Turn right 90 degrees
•Move 200 steps
•Turn right 90 degrees

Sprite starts at home base at x=-100; y=-50
•Sprite says “I hit the ball” for 2 seconds
•Sprite runs (east) 200 steps to 1st base
•Sprite changes color
•Sprite runs 200 steps to 2nd base (north: left turn from 1st base)
•Sprite doubles size
•Sprite says “I hit a double” for 5 seconds

repeat 10 Say “AAAHHHH” for a short time Then grow the cat 5 bigger , 
Repeat 20 times Briefly say “CCHHEEEW” Then shrink the cat’s size by 5

repeat 10

We can randomly set the location of the bat so it will “flutter”.
•Set X to a random number
•Set Y to a random number
•Move the bat to location (X,Y)
•Of course, the bat should remain on stage!
